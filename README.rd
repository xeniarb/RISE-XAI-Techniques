#RISE-XAI-Techniques: Getting Started with Pre-Softmax Adversarial Attacks on Saliency Maps

##Explanation of RISE-xai-techniques
RISE (Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation) is an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique designed to generate saliency or importance maps that highlight which parts of an input image most influence a deep neural networkâ€™s prediction. Unlike white-box methods relying on internal model states like gradients, RISE treats the model as a black-box, producing importance maps by probing it with randomly masked versions of the input image and observing output changes. This technique enhances interpretability by visually explaining predictions of complex AI models, especially in computer vision.

##What This Notebook Does
This notebook demonstrates the application of RISE alongside other popular XAI methods such as Grad-CAM, LIME, Integrated Gradients, Vanilla and Guided Backpropagation, and Deconvolution for explaining image classification models (e.g., VGG19). It includes examples of generating saliency maps for different classes in images of cats and dogs, showcasing how adversarial attacks can fool gradient-based attribution methods using pre-softmax outputs. The notebook integrates preparation steps, cloning necessary repositories, image preprocessing, and visualization of explanations for selected class indices. It serves as a practical starting point for understanding and experimenting with adversarial attacks and interpretability techniques in deep learning.
